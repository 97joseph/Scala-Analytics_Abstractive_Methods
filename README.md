# Scala-Analytics_Abstractive_Methods

Abstractive methods and method transparency

Scala Part 4
Important (Please Read):
● Do not leave any test cases running in your code because this might slow down your
program! Comment out test cases before submission, otherwise you might hit a time‑out.
● Do not use any mutable data structures in your submissions! They are not needed. This
means you cannot create new Arrays or ListBuffers, for example.
● Do not use return in your code! It has a different meaning in Scala than in Java. It
changes the meaning of your program, and you should never use it.
● Do not use var! This declares a mutable variable. Only use val!
● Do not use any parallel collections! No .par therefore! Our testing and marking
infrastructure is not set up for it.
● Also note that the running time of each part will be restricted to a maximum of 30
seconds on my laptop.
● Please comment out any test cases (println) because the program is fed into another
algorithm.
Disclaimer
All major OSes, including Windows, have a commandline. So there is no good reason to not
download Scala, install it and run it on your own computer.
Also note that the running time of each part will be restricted to a maximum of 30 seconds on
my laptop: If you calculate a result once, try to avoid to calculate the result again. Feel free to
copy any code you need from files knight1.scala, knight2.scala and knight3.scala.
